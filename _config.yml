  Hello! I am a graduate student studying data journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. I am focusing on health and science reporting, but really just want to make some spreadsheets for you.  
  <br>
  I'm  looking for a summer internship in 2021 and get some newsroom experience. Or virtual newsroom experience. You get it.
